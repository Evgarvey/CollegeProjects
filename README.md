Some projects I made in college. There's 2 different examples here:

CIS400Assignment1.py is an example of a more casual application of my Python knowledge. My comments aren't as large as they would be on a larger project however I still apply good coding habits and demonstrate a solid knowledge of Python.

TwitterAnalysis.py was written for one of my last projects in college, focusing on using NLTK to perform sentiment analysis on tweets taken from the Twitter API. My commenting is much more in-depth here, and the code is structured better for easier interpretation.
